                                Probably the worst month of my life(yeah, I know JEE time was rough). Got dengue, Had no idea about college studies and the end sems going on, procastinating everything, wasting time on youtube and other stuff, saying everyone that I am coding(a question in a week and that too a supereasy one) Now the teaching hobby sucks.

                                Started Competitive Coding, finally... with a friend of mine, knew nothing about him, met him on induction and then started competitive coding with him. Great man, wrked as a team, had a great time with him, made a best friend forever, thanks, if you are reading this you palindrome string.

                                Got 3 star on codechef and started doing more competitive coding. Got my results of first sem, 6.9 CGPA, was broke confused, again procastinating things, making them overcomplicated like only thinking about doing Data Structures but never actually did.

                                Finally everything over and the lovely quarantine. Did competitive Coding to the fullest and had a good grasp on questions but still was not concentrating on data structures and algorithms, got 3400 rank in google kickstart(not at all a great achievement)Still planning. Special thanks to my new friend who was great at competitive coding as well as had a boosting energy and I was really affected by him, thanks man if you seeing this article mastermind.

                                Things began to sort. Learned HTML, CSS, some JAVASCRIPT. Really was overwhelmed by everything, wanted to utilized most of the time. Actually got many skills, saw many videos on GSOC and other stuff, got ill again but still, got something in the box, let's hope for the best, meanwhile would hopefully get 4 star in codechef
